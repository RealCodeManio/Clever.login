    <div class="section-text">
    <p>Hey it's Nebelung, I know this is Echo's blog but I'm making a little post about version 4 of 3kh0.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The website you are on now, thats v4! I started this version with the vision of a clean easy to use and sexy looking new version of 3kh0. This site has many new features like JSON loading for games and themes but it also has fun animation and easter eggs.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Fun Facts:<br>1. Development was started on Jan 3, 2023 just after the new year :D<br>2. Version 4 was made from scratch, it's not just an updated version of v3.<br>3. The default and Orchid themes are from the two buttons on the homepage of v3.<br>4. Why don't you click on the logo?</p>
    <br>
    <p>So play the games, add a review or look around for easter eggs and enjoy your stay.</p>
    <p>Hopefully v5 will be even better whenever that happens and I hope you all enjoy this amazing site as much as I do!</p>
    <p>- Nebelung</p>
